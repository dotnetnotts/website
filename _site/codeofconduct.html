							We believe that every single person has the right to take part in .NET Notts events
							and online communities in a safe andwelcoming environment. Inclusivity is important to us.
						</p>
						<p tabIndex="0">
							In order to avoid any situtations where an attendee may feel
							uncomfortable we ask that you not only treat others in the
							manner that you would expect to be treated, but also to
							respect what makes other people feel comfortable. As part of
							this we ask that speakers and representatives of the event try
							to refrain from language or actions that may be considered
							offensive.
						</p>
						<p tabIndex="0">
							Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or
							written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation,
							sexual behaviour, disability, physical appearance, body size,
							race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
							intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
							recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
							inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
							attention.

							If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable,
							that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing
							it.

							expected to comply immediately. Sponsors, organisers,
							speakers, volunteers, and anyone else at any of

							may take any action .NET Notts deems
							appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from
							the events and our online communities with no eligibility for
